# TODO
## Feature Requests
This is a list of items that I eventually want to add.
* Expand tabs into spaces when reading files
* Show the COMMAND BUFFER on the bottom of the screen (maybe towards the bottom right) to make it clearer for user to see what they're typing
* Undo/redo (up to a maximum memory cap, e.g., 100 commands)
* Add configuration options to allow for things like changing the default tab spaces
* Search and find/replace
* Probably some others to come
